Divar Crawler

### Description
This is one of those projects that one looks back on and thinks, "wtf was I thinking?"  
Anyway, this is basically an interface between Divar's housing section. It is supposed to crawl Divar and extract information in excel.  
Though nothing works now. Stored important data in pickle files :) Amazing.  

### TODOS
- Write todos
- clean up
- don't use excell, use proper database storage.
  - Although it's already using db.
  - So just stop using excell. It's pointless now.
- Definitely remove module isfahan. That's hilarious. Use dynamic conventions' idiot.
